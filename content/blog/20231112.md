## Christ and The Children: "Behold your little ones."
### 3 Nephi 17:11-15
>11 And it came to pass that [Jesus] commanded that their little children should be brought.
>
>12 So they brought their little children and set them down upon the ground round about him, and Jesus stood in the midst; and the multitude gave way till they had all been brought unto him.
>
>13 And it came to pass that when they had all been brought, and Jesus stood in the midst, he commanded the multitude that they should kneel down upon the ground.
>
>14 And it came to pass that when they had knelt upon the ground, Jesus groaned within himself, and said: Father, I am troubled because of the wickedness of the people of the house of Israel.
>
>15 And when he had said these words, he himself also knelt upon the earth; and behold he prayed unto the Father, and the things which he prayed cannot be written, and the multitude did bear record who heard him.{class="prose-quoteless}

### 3 Nephi 17:18-24
>18 And it came to pass that when Jesus had made an end of praying unto the Father, he arose; but so great was the joy of the multitude that they were overcome.
>
>19 And it came to pass that Jesus spake unto them, and bade them arise.
>
>20 And they arose from the earth, and he said unto them: Blessed are ye because of your faith. And now behold, my joy is full.
>
>21 And when he had said these words, he wept, and the multitude bare record of it, and he took their little children, one by one, and blessed them, and prayed unto the Father for them.
>
>22 And when he had done this he wept again;
>
>23 And he spake unto the multitude, and said unto them: Behold your little ones.
>
>24 And as they looked to behold they cast their eyes towards heaven, and they saw the heavens open, and they saw angels descending out of heaven as it were in the midst of fire; and they came down and encircled those little ones about, and they were encircled about with fire; and the angels did minister unto them.{class="prose-quoteless"}

### Brother Newman
>Wouldn’t it be wonderful if our children could have experiences like that with Jesus Christ—something that would bind their hearts to Him! He invites us, as He invited those parents in the Book of Mormon, to bring our little ones to Him.

## President Nelson: "Where can we go to hear Him?"
### 2 Nephi 25:26
>26 And we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins.{class="prose-quoteless}
- [2 Nephi 25:26](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25?lang=eng&id=p26#p26){target="_blank"}

### Brother Newman
>Nephi’s words imply a constant, ongoing effort to teach our children about Christ. We can ensure that the voice of the covenant people is not silent in the ears of the rising generation and that Jesus is not a Sunday-only topic.
>
>The voice of the covenant people is found in our own words of testimony. It is found in the words of living prophets. And it is preserved powerfully in the scriptures. It is there that our children will come to know Jesus and find answers to their questions. It is there they will learn for themselves the doctrine of Christ. It is there they will find hope. This will prepare them for a lifetime of seeking truth and living on the covenant path.

### President Nelson
>Where can we go to hear Him?
>
>We can go to the scriptures. They teach us about Jesus Christ and His gospel, the magnitude of His Atonement, and our Father’s great plan of happiness and redemption. Daily immersion in the word of God is crucial for spiritual survival, especially in these days of increasing upheaval. As we feast on the words of Christ daily, the words of Christ will tell us how to respond to difficulties we never thought we would face.
