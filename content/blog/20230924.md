### Question

**How has charity and forgiveness changed you?**

### Quote 1

> When we think of charity, our minds usually turn to generous acts and donations to relieve the suffering of those who are experiencing physical, material, or emotional difficulties. Still, charity is not only related to something we donate to someone, but it’s an attribute of the Savior and can become part of our character. It is not surprising that the Lord instructed us to clothe ourselves "with the bond of charity, … which is the bond of perfectness and peace." Without charity, we are nothing and we cannot inherit the place the Lord has prepared for us in the mansions of our Heavenly Father. <sup>[[link](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2023/04/43soares?lang=eng&id=p5#p5)]</sup>

### Quote 2

> Another important aspect to emphasize, and one that has direct implications on our discipleship and how we promote the peace of the Savior, is the manner in which we treat each other. During His earthly ministry, the Savior’s teachings focused—not only, but particularly—on the virtues of love, charity, patience, humility, and compassion—fundamental attributes to those who want to become closer to Him and promote His peace. Such attributes are gifts from God, and as we strive to develop them, we will begin to see our neighbor’s differences and weaknesses with more empathy, sensitivity, respect, and tolerance. One of the most evident signs that we are drawing closer to the Savior and becoming more like Him is the loving, patient, and kind way with which we treat our fellow beings, whatever the circumstances. <sup>[[link](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2023/04/43soares?lang=eng&id=p7#p7)]</sup>

### Quote 3

> It is not surprising that one of the adversary’s tactics is to stir up enmity and hate in the hearts of God’s children. He rejoices when he sees people criticizing, ridiculing, and slandering one another. This behavior can destroy a person’s character, reputation, and self-esteem, particularly when the person is judged unfairly. It is critical to point out that when we allow this type of attitude in our lives, we make room in our hearts for the enemy to plant the seed of discord among us, risking falling into his voracious trap...

> My dear brothers and sisters, as we strive to develop attributes like the Savior’s, we can become instruments of His peace in the world according to the pattern that He Himself established. I invite you to consider ways we can transform ourselves into uplifting and supportive people, people who have an understanding and forgiving heart, people who look for the best in others, always remembering that "if there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things." <sup>[[link](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2023/04/43soares?lang=eng&id=p10,p12#p10)]</sup>
